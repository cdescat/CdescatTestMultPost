# TestMultiPosting
This CSV file was generated by crawling data out of offers seen at : http://multiposting.fr/fr/a_propos/recrutement.
After extracting the javascript code contained in source (via xpath selector), it is parsed to isolate the feeding URL and join it to current URL (so it works with both absolute and relative URL).
A scrapy.Request is done with this URL, taking a parseJSON method as the callback function.
Response.body is loaded with json.loads, and if extracted data exist, a csv.writer is instantiated.
Then, a header row containing column names is writen to offer.csv.
Finally, each offer contained in the loaded JSON file is encoded to utf8 standard, then writen attribute by attribute to offer.csv as a single row.
